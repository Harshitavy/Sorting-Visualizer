# Sorting-Visualizer
The Sorting Visualizer is an immersive project to understand the fundamentals of sorting algorithms and explore various sorting algorithms in real-time .

# Controls for the Sorting Visualizer:

To generate a different randomized list, enter 0.
Start the Selection Sort Algorithm with 1.
Start the Insertion Sort Algorithm with 2.
Start the Bubble Sort Algorithm with 3.
Start the Merge Sort Algorithm with 4.
Start the Quick Sort Algorithm with 5.
Start the Heap Sort Algorithm with 6.
To quit the Sorting Visualizer, press q.

# Features
1. Real-Time Visualization: See the sorting algorithms in action as the visualizer animates the step-by-step process of rearranging components into their proper order.
2. Multiple Sorting Algorithms: Implement a number of sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and heap Sort. The visualizer clearly demonstrates each algorithm.
