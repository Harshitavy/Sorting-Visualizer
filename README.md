# Sorting-Visualizer
The Sorting Visualizer is an immersive project to understand the fundamentals of sorting algorithms and explore various sorting algorithms in real-time .

# Project overview

Developing a sorting visualizer is a fantastic project that enhances both web development skills and deepens understanding of fundamental data structures. It not only sharpens the ability to create interactive and visually appealing interfaces but also reinforces key concepts in organizing and manipulating data efficiently.

# Features
1. Real-Time Visualization: See the sorting algorithms in action as the visualizer animates the step-by-step process of rearranging components into their proper order.
2. Multiple Sorting Algorithms: Implement a number of sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and heap Sort. The visualizer clearly demonstrates each algorithm.
